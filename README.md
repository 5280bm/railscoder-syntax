# Railscoder Syntax theme (Material)
A fork of Gum Joe's 'One Dark Material' syntax theme, which uses a material color pallet. Designed with Atom's One Dark Adaptive Theme.

## Why?
I was a fan of Gum Joe's work on 'One Dark Material' but wanted a few more tweaks to add more contrast.

## Example

![one-dark-syntax](https://github.com/locomotivedigital/railscoder-syntax/blob/main/example/example.png)

### Installation
```bash
apm install Gum-Joe/one-dark-material-syntax
```
